# PhysioShoe
This is a Capstone Design project for the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering. The PhysioShoe is a low-cost basic gait analysis system. Embedded in the shoe is an insole with a matrix of wires. At each intersection, we get a reading of how much pressure is applied. By multiplexing through the array, we are able to create a pressure contour map. In addition, we are using a MEMS MPU-9250 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer in order to categorize the orientation of the foot as a patient walks. The microcontroller we are using is the ESP32. We chose this microcontroller since it houses several GPIO and analog pins, along with a dual core processor. We are programming the microcontroller in the Arduino environment, due to its easy to use interface and low barrier for entry into programming.
